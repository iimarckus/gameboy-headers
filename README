This is a JSON database of the header values of all ROMs in a complete
No‐Intro licensed ROM set.

If you find any missing or wrong values, contact me at: iimarckus@gmail.com

Some notes:

Caesar's Palace and Prince of Persia have “EJM” in the header. These are
probably the initials of programmer Ed Magnin.

The USA/Europe release of NBA All Star Challenge 1 & 2 has “FF” for the
new licensee and SGB values.

Gluecksrad contains the only non-ASCII title (“GLÜCKSRAD”).
